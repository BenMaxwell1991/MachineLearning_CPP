# MachineLearning_CPP

A stand alone, from scratch, C++ command line program, designed to create a Neural Network, along with an appropriate set of random XOR training data. 
The network will then iterate over the training data, teaching itself to become an XOR gate. 
Feedback is periodically reported so you can observe the learning process.
